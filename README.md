### File Structure

## 📦 project-root/
### ├── 📁 assets/
### ├── 📁 components/
### ---------├── 🔐 Authentication/
### ---------├── 📝 Create/
### ---------├── 📊 DetailsData/
### ---------├── 📥 Fetchdata/
### ---------Ah, thank you for clarifying! You want to display the **file structure vertically, step by step**, like a **tree view** — that's the standard and cleanest way to show file structure in a `README.md`.

You can achieve this by using a **code block** (with triple backticks) and some folder and file emojis.

### ✅ Vertically Displayed File Structure (Copy This into README.md)

<pre>
```bash
📦 project-root/
├── 📁 assets/
├── 📁 components/
│   ├── 🔐 Authentication/
│   ├── 📝 Create/
│   ├── 📊 DetailsData/
│   ├── 📥 Fetchdata/
│   ├── 🧭 Navbar/
│   └── 🧩 SingleCreate/
├── 📁 Files/
│   └── 🏠 Home/
├── 📄 App.js
├── 🔥 firebase.js
└── 🧵 main.js
```
</pre>

### 📌 How to Use It

1. Paste it exactly as shown above into your `README.md`.
2. GitHub will render the file structure **as a monospace vertical tree**, with emojis.
3. You can adjust or add more folders/files as your project grows.

Would you also like to **add short descriptions** beside each folder or file? I can help format that too.
